  headline: Our Vision
  subtitle: Our founder, Sandra, has two boys with special needs. Her oldest also
    struggled with chronic skin irritation. Many of the creams and ointments she used
    to help him had ingredients that were synthetic and full of chemicals. Over time
    and after much research, she discovered that organic and natural products worked
    best on his skin. Even more amazing, she realized that because these natural ingredients
    were readily available in health food stores, she could create the products herself.
    With 3 or 4 all natural ingredients and recipes perfected over years, **Eli’s
    Balms** was born.

  - title: We love plants
    description: Now THAT is true, but we love web development even more. We talk
      about it on our blog, like, [a lot](http://bit.ly/2YA6999). We often craft live
      demos and open source these bad boys [on GitHub](https://github.com/snipcart).
      Matter of fact, this Planty theme [is open source too](https://github.com/snipcart/stackbit-theme-planty)!
      If you spot any bugs, open an issue, and we’ll fire our junior dev. Just kidding
      Michael, you’re good.

  - title: We think plants are the future
    description: Word. But good **code** _can_ solve a lots of problems, too. New
      _and_ old. That’s why we help beginners get started with web development through
      free content and tools, like this theme. We also believe [the JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)
      might be one solid pillar on which we build that future.
